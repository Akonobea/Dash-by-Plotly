# Exercises to help you get started with Dash 

1. Customize the layout so the dropdown and the choropleth graph are next to each other on the page. The total width of columns inside one row must be equal or less than 12. Hint - see the second example in [Dash Bootstrap docs](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/docs/components/layout/).
2. Modify the app so it plots a bar graph instead of the choropleth graph. The x-axis should represent states while the yaxis should represent the `column_name` from the dropdown. See Plotly docs on [the bar chart](https://plotly.com/python/bar-charts/).    
3. to be continued.
