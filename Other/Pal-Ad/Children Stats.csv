Accordingly, the journey to interrogation can take many hours and sometimes days. During this time children frequently report being left tied and blindfolded in shipping containers or left outside in caged areas exposed to the elements. Some children report being treated with respect and dignity, but in many cases, children report neglect, abuse, sleep deprivation, humiliation, prolonged exposure to the elements, lack of food and water, and limited access to toilets. Accordingly, most children are interrogated in a state of physical and mental exhaustion, sometimes in the middle of the night."
